=========

This is a modified version. The two versions of original code I 
used are renamed to GingerBreak_original_v1.c and 
GingerBreak_original_v2.c. My modified code is called
GingerBreak.c in this archive, and should be completely 
based on v2. But in the odd chance a few lines from v1 remain,
I included that as well.

The Android Exploid Crew
========================

Brings you last time in history, in the April of 2011,
since already disbanded:


Android 2.2-3.0 softbreaks
--------------------------

As always:

<ATTENTION>

This code is under the GPL.
It comes with absolutely NO WARRANTY, and you cant blame
me for any damage it may cause.

This program may make your device completely unusable and broken.
You may loose all your data and warranty of the device!

The program is intended for educational and demonstration
purposes only.

Before using the softbreak, remove your SD card or any removable
media, or insert an empty one. Gingerbreak is going to exploit
the volume manager so if you have bad luck it might be that
it is erasing data while being executed.

</ATTENTION>


If you like what we are doing you can send us PayPal money to
7-4-3-C@web.de so we can compensate time, effort and HW costs.
But you are not forced to do so.

The binary has to be uploaded to the device via "adb push"
inside a writable and executable directory:

/data/local/tmp

After executing, it is self-explaining. After seeing '#' you
are root. The jailbreaking has actually been done then,
no matter what other tutorials tell you! You might want
to install your Superuser.apk then in order to enable
tethering etc. You can use one of the many instructions found
on the web to do so.

This softbreak is exploiting an out of bounds array access. The
nature of these bugs make such exploits way more unstable than
logic flaws as used by RageAgainstTheCage. So its likely that
Gingerbreak is not running on as many devices as RageAgainstTheCage
without adjusting offsets or indexes. The Jailbreaker cannot
always live in Maryland and give sweet candy to everyone!

Please NOTE:

The softbreak is designed to be only executable by the legit
owner of the device, as it needs adb-shell access.
However, the vulnerability inside vold which is used to obtain
root privileges might be exploited by malware from inside an APK
as well. That means, kick your carrier in the ass in order to get
updates if you dont want this hole staying open for yourself.
